# Complete Solution for nirvikgroup.com Deployment Issues

## Root Cause
The GitHub Actions build keeps failing because:
1. Vite can't resolve the entry module "index.html" 
2. The build context is incorrect between root and client directories
3. Dependencies aren't properly accessible during build

## Final Working Solution

Replace your entire `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with this configuration:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches: [ nirvik_page, main ]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20'
        cache: 'npm'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
      
    - name: Create client build directory
      run: mkdir -p dist
        
    - name: Build with explicit paths
      run: |
        export NODE_ENV=production
        npx vite build \
          --config client/vite.config.ts \
          --root client \
          --outDir ../dist \
          --emptyOutDir
        
    - name: Setup Pages
      uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
      
    - name: Upload artifact
      uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
      with:
        path: './dist'
        
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      id: deployment
      uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

## Alternative Manual Deployment

If GitHub Actions continues to fail, you can deploy manually:

1. Run locally: `cd client && npm run build`
2. Copy the `dist` folder contents to your GitHub repository
3. Push to `nirvik_page` branch
4. Enable GitHub Pages to serve from root directory

## Expected Results

After successful deployment:
- Navigation bar will appear properly
- Layout will be organized instead of fragmented
- Mobile responsiveness will work correctly
- CSS styling will render properly
- Website will match the development version

The key fix is using explicit Vite build parameters to ensure proper file resolution and output directory configuration.
